# Examples

## Dynex Circuits: n.Quantum Gate Circuits

Quantum circuits provide a visual representation of the sequence of operations performed on qubits during computation. Think of quantum circuits as a recipe or set of instructions that detail what operations to perform on each qubit and when to perform them. By arranging and executing these operations in specific ways, we can implement various quantum algorithms.

```
import dynex
import dynex_circuit
import pennylane as qml

dev = qml.device("default.qubit", wires=2)

# Define the quantum circuit:
@qml.qnode(dev)
def circuit(params):
    qml.Hadamard(wires = 0)
    qml.CNOT(wires = [0,1])
    qml.RZ(params[0], wires = 0)
    return qml.probs(wires = [0,1])

# Input parameters:
params = [0.1]

# draw circuit:
_ = qml.draw_mpl(circuit, style="black_white", expansion_strategy="device")(params)

# Execute on Dynex:
measure = dynex_circuit.execute(circuit, params, method='measure', shots=1, mainnet=True)
print(measure)

# Tools for Quantum Algorithm Development on Dynex
 
Dynex's platform supports a variety of tools for creating and working with both n.quantum gate circuits and n.quantum annealing models:

For quantum gate circuits, support for tools such as Qiskit, Cirq, Pennylane, and OpenQASM are seamlessly integrated into the Dynex platform, enabling users to leverage these advanced quantum gate circuit languages. This enables the execution of well-known quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm for efficient problem-solving in number theory, Grover's algorithm for database search, Simon's algorithm for finding hidden periods, or the Deutsch-Josza algorithm for determining the parity of a function.

For n.quantum annealing, tools like Dimod offer a shared API for samplers and provide classes for quadratic and higher-order models. PyQUBO allows the easy creation of QUBOs or Ising models from flexible mathematical expressions, complete with automatic constraint validation and parameter tuning. AutoQUBO by Fujitsu Research automates the conversion of Python functions to QUBO representations, facilitating the use of Ising machines on the Dynex platform to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Qubolite, developed by the Lamarr Institute, is a lightweight toolbox in NumPy for creating, analyzing, and solving QUBO instances, incorporating cutting-edge research algorithms. 

This comprehensive support ensures that both quantum gate circuits and quantum annealing models can be efficiently executed on the Dynex neuromorphic computing platform.
