    "*The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) concerns finding the shortest path that a traveling salesman can take to go through a list of cities in the shortest time possible. This problem is represented in a graph $G =(V,E)$. Each vertex in the graph $G$ represents a different camp, while the weights on each of the edges $(u,v)$ represent the distance between the two camps $u$ and $v$.* \n",

    "We start off with a 3 node graph without restrictions on sarting and ending nodes, and full connectivity between nodes. In this case, the fully connected graph has $N^2$ degrees of freedom, correspnding to the $N$ nodes being able to be in any of the $N$ positions in the cycle.\n",
    "To find a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once, reducing at the same time the cost of the cycle, we will encode the position of each verteX in the cycle using $N^2$  qubits and defining $\\ket{k}_{iN+j}$, $k = 0,1$ as the states in which the vertex i is (k = 1) or is not (k = 0) in position j in the cycle.\n",
    "To construct the hamiltonian we will follow the formulation of the TSP given in [5]. The only difference from that formulation is that instead of working with the operator (1+Z)/2, which has eigenvalues 0 and 1 on the single-qubit states $\\ket{1}$ and $\\ket{0}$, respectively, we will work with the operator (1-Z)/2, so that the eigenvalues match with the label of the states. With this in mind, the total hamiltonian describing the problem to be solved consists of 4 different terms that can be split into the hamiltonian cycle problem itself (first 3 terms) and the tsp problem of minimizing the cycle's cost (last term). In our case, we will label them h_cycle and h_tsp, respectively.\n",
