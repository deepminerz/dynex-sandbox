    "There are many different variations of the electric vehicle charger placement problem that might be considered. For this demo, we examine the case in which a small region is under consideration, and all locations in our area of consideration are within walking distance. In this situation, we want to place new charging locations that are convenient to all POIs. For example, if the POIs are shops on a main street it is most convenient to park once in a central location. We will satisfy this need by considering the average distance from a potential new charging location all POIs. Additionally, we want to place new chargers away from existing and other new charging locations so as to minimize overlap and maximize coverage of the region.\n",
